# Kubernetes the hard way with vagrant

This is a port of Kelsey Hightower project called [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), originally created for GCP. The aim of this project is to build a similar setup, but based on well-known product Vagrant. It allows you to build your own Kubernetes cluster for learning purposes without access to any public cloud provides. The only limit is your PC Hardware :)

## Differences with the Kelsey version

* Uses Vagrant instead of GCP as an infrastructure
* Uses CentOS7 images
